# When adding a new camera, you need to read it's xml feature file using arv-tool
# This requires that you have both an appropriate version of arv-tool and glib in your path.
# Here's how to easily do this w/ SLAC pkg_mgr
export PSPKG_RELEASE=ADCore-2.1
source $PSPKG_ROOT/etc/set_env.sh

# Then run arv-tool-0.4 to search for available genicam cameras
# The first line is the camera name, and the 2nd the model
% arv-tool-0.4
Allied Vision Technologies-50-0503349286
Basler-21664550

# Then run arv-tool-0.4 -n CAMERA_NAME genicam > CAMERA_NAME.xml
# to fetch the xml feature spec
# If arv-tool generates errors, check the line numbers in the error msgs
# and fix any flaws in the generated xml.
# (My first 2 Baslers both generated xml w/ 'bCustom"' instead of '"Custom"'
% arv-tool-0.4 -n "Allied Vision Technologies-50-0503349286" genicam > Basler_acA1300-30gm.xml

# Lastly, run the python script to create new db and edl files from the feature file
% aravisGigEApp/src/makeDbAndEdl.py Basler_acA1300-30gm.xml Baslter_aca1300-30gm

# Note: I found that different Basler camera models had identical xml feature files,
# but different image dimensions.
#
# For EPICS, we need the camera's max height, width, and pixels per image
# in order to allocate waveform records.
# The xml feature file doesn't specify this, so you'll need to create a MODEL_NAME.env
# file by hand to do this, using google or experimentation to determine the image size.
# Setting these values too large wastes memory and network bandwidth, but can be
# done temporarily so you can see what aravis queries when you run your ioc.
